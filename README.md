# Efficient Government Framework
a framework for open efficient government operations
The idea is to write a political system entirely in code which will be beneficial to the future world and the entire human society.
The goal is to design a system that maximize the welfare of entire human race, with special attention to maximize the walfare of its citizens. At the end we are trying to build a transparent, highly efficient organization system with collaborative effort from the best ideas in the world.

As world evolve, system change might be needed. A voting system will be establised for changing the source code of this system. But the core concept of maximizing general welfare of human cannot be changed and should be writttn into constitution.

This framework is in preparation for a more automated world where robotics replaces human in many aspect of daily operation. In this case, a highly efficient, specific system would be needed to define how society work.
